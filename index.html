<p>Audio Localizer is the final project for Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurements (ISIM).</p>
<p>It is based on an aggressive band-pass filter around clap frequency (20 kHz), to localize the sound source.</p>
<p>The Arduino acts as the communication channel between the four sonar sensors and the servo.</p>
<p>Computation occurs on the main computer with SymPy, and returns the result to the arduino.</p>
<p>The location is visualized with PyQt4.</p>

<p>Arduino then takes the input and, based on the identified location, rotates the arrow mounted on the servo to point towards the sound source.</p>
